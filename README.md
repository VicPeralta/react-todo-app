The App, at this stage, contains five components:   
- *TodoContainer*. It is a class-based component that is responsible for holding the **state** of the application and contains the Header, InputTodo and the TodoList components. As it is the owner of the **state**, it is responsible for sending this information to the TodoList Component. It is also responsible of receiving the updated information from the InputTodo (to add a new todo), from the TodoList (to update the completed status or deleting a todo) and update the state.   
- *InputTodo*. A class-based component responsible for receiving the input from the user and notifying its parent about this information.   
- *Header*. A functional component that contains the App's title.   
- *TodoList*. A class-based component that hold the list of todos. It up-lift the events  coming from the todos to its parent Component.   
- *TodoItem*. A class-based component responsible for showing the todo and responding to the user interaction.
